<h1>MountV2:</h1>

- Original File: https://github.com/xbst/Birds-Nest/tree/master/CAD/Mounts/V2

- Remix Description: The base has been extended upwards so that the PCB can be mounted lower down. The horizontal bar across the top needs to be removed. I did this physically
post-print but it could easily be edited in the STL.
