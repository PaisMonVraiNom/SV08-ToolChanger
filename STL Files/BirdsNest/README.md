MountV2:

This is a remix of the Birdsnest PCB mount in the XBST Birds-Nest repository https://github.com/xbst/Birds-Nest/tree/master/CAD/Mounts/V2
The base has been extended upwards so that the PCB can be mounted lower down. The horizontal bar across the top needs removing. I did this physically
post-print but could easily be edited in the STL.
